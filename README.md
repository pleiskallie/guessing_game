This is my readme file for guessing_game.html
1. This is the secret club membership game!
2. This game is a security measure to ensure that all secret club members actually know that they are, in fact, members of the club.
3. The game will first ask, the most important question of course, if the user is a member of the secret club or not ?
4. If the member assures the game that 'Yes' they are a member, they will be prompted to enter their name and email for, of course, some further confirmations
5. If the user is not a member, and answers 'No' the user will be reassured of their status as a non-member.

These are the edits for Kallie's README file.
